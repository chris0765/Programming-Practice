    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank" title="JavaScript specification">
    JavaScript</a> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.<br>
    JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.<br>
    It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.<br><br>
    Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.<br>
    JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.<br>
    The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior, 
    and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.<br><br>
    <img src="JS.png" width="10%">
    </p><p style="margin-top:45px;">As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, 
    and imperative programming styles.<br>
    It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, 
    standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).<br>
    However, the language itself does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, 
    as the host environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs.<br><br>
    JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded in some servers, usually via Node.js.<br>
    They are also embedded in a variety of applications created with frameworks such as Electron and Cordova.<br><br>
    Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, 
    and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.<br><br>
