    <h2>WEB</h2>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">
    The World Wide Web (WWW)</a>, commonly known as the Web, 
    is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified 
    by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked by hypertext, 
    and are accessible over the Internet.<br>
    The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 
    and may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser and are published 
    by a software application called a web server.<br><br>
    English engineer and computer scientist Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989.<br>
    He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland.<br>
    The browser was released outside CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 
    and then to the general public in August 1991.<br>
    The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age and is the primary tool billions 
    of people use to interact on the Internet.<br><br>
    <img src="WEB.png" width="30%">
    </p><p style="margin-top:45px;">Web resources may be any type of downloaded media, 
    but web pages are hypertext media that have been formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).<br>
    Such formatting allows for embedded hyperlinks that contain URLs and permit users to navigate to other web resources.<br>
    In addition to text, web pages may contain references to images, video, audio, 
    and software components which are displayed in the user's web browser as coherent pages of multimedia content.<br><br>
    Multiple web resources with a common theme, a common domain name, or both, make up a website.<br>
    Websites are stored in computers that are running a program called a web server that responds to requests 
    made over the Internet from web browsers running on a user's computer.<br>
    Website content can be largely provided by a publisher, or interactively where users contribute content 
    or the content depends upon the users or their actions.<br>
    Websites may be provided for a myriad of informative, entertainment, commercial, governmental, or non-governmental reasons.<br><br>
