        Cascading Style Sheets (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>) 
        is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.<br>
        CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.<br><br>
        CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.<br>
        This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control 
        in the specification of presentation characteristics, 
        enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, 
        and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.<br><br>
